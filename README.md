# Hackintosh EFI

The Hackintosh is based on OpenCore (`0.6.8` at time of writing) and `macOS BigSur 11.3` following the Dortania [Dortania Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) for [Comet Lake](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config.plist/comet-lake.html#starting-point).

## Details

### BIOS

There is no CFG-lock issue with this board. Installing BIOS version 0707 is worth it as it enables higher resolutions in the boot loader screen for me.

Things I changed from default:

* Fast boot: OFF
* Intel Virtualization Technology: ON
* OS type: Windows UEFI
* Multi Monitor support: ON
* Clear the platform key as this disables secure boot.

### SSDTs

Compiled by following the [Dortania's ACPI Guide](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/)

* SSDT-AWAC (enable the legacy RTC clock)
* SSDT-EC-USBX (Fix embedded controller)
* SSDT-PLUG (Power management)
* SSDT-RHUB (reset USB controller)
* SSDT-SBUS-MCHC (SMBus support)
* [SSDT-RX5700XT](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/amd-radeon-performance-enhanced-ssdt.296555/) (Better support for RX5600/5700)

### Kexts

Download them from their official repo

* [AppleALC.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC) - Audio
* [FakePCIID.kext](https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-Fake-PCI-ID) and FakePCIID_Intel_HDMI_Audio.kext - Also needed for audio to work
* [IntelMausi.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/IntelMausi) - Ethernet
* [Lilu.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu) - Enables various patching
* [NVMeFix.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/NVMeFix) - Better NVMe support
* [VirtualSMC](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC) SMCProcessor.kext, SMCSuperIO.kext, VirtualSMC.kext - SMC emulator
* USB-Map.kext - Available from the kexts folder in this repo. This maps the 6 USB3 ports and the two internal ones used for Bluetooth and the Aura header. See USB section.
* [WhateverGreen.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen) - Various graphics related patches
* [XHCI-unsupported.kext](https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-USB-Inject-All) - There is a patched version of this in this repo. Needed for USB3 to work.
* [DAGPM.kext](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/amd-radeon-performance-enhanced-ssdt.296555/) - Better power management for AMD Navi GPUs.
* [HibernationFixup.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/HibernationFixup) - Added this back as it seems like my computer crashed when in sleep mode for more than 24h. Need more testing to see if this fixes it though.

### USB

This board has two USB controllers. The Intel one that drives the 6 USB3 ports on the rear panel as well as Bluetooth and the Aura header. I'm not using the internal USB ports - so the supplied USB Map will not map these. Currently 14 ports are mapped - so there is room for one more logical port. The second controller is for the rear USB-C port and it doesn't need a USB map.

The front USB ports that I didn't map have the following IDs (thanks to [zhzhzh88](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/hbcdgq/asus_rog_strix_b460i_gaming_mobo_hackintosh/g8cmw5b?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)):

* HS01, port 0x01 (USB2)
* HS02, port 0x02 (USB2)
* SS01, port 0x11 (USB3)
* SS02, port 0x12 (USB3)

In addition to the USB-Map.kext you also need the modified `XHCI-unsuported.kext` to enable USB3 ports.

### Note on Navi GPU

I found that installing the kext and SSDT from [here](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/amd-radeon-performance-enhanced-ssdt.296555/) not only improves Geekbench scores (see below), but also real world performance in Mafia III. Without it the GPU seemed to thermal throttle after a few minutes of playing and the frame rate would drop really low. Interestingly I did not see this happen with [Unigine Heaven](https://benchmark.unigine.com/heaven) which is much harder on the GPU.

### Config.plist

#### Kernel

 Quirks > DisableRtcChecksum = TRUE - This prevents the BIOS from restarting into safe mode
 Misc > Boot > HibernateMode = Auto - Not sure if this is necessary. The machine sleeps fine without this, but maybe this enables deeper hibernation.
 All other settings follow the Dortania guide.

#### PlatformInfo

I used the iMac19,1 SMBIOS because that was what the guide recommended at the time. It has now been updated to use iMac20,1 instead. So I would use this for a new build. But since I haven't found any issues with iMac19,1 I see no reason to change it.

## OC Version tags

- [0.6.8](https://github.com/yqlbu/Hackintosh-EFI/releases/tag/v0.6.8)

## Upgrade Guide

**Step 0** -- Download the latest version of `OpenCore Bootloader` from [https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases), find the file named `OpenCanopy.efi` from `x64` >> `EFI` >> `OC` >> `Drivers`, and find `OpenCore.efi`, drag them out for later use

**Step 1** -- Download the latest GUI driver from [https://github.com/acidanthera/OcBinaryData](https://github.com/acidanthera/OcBinaryData) and copy the `Resource` folder over to the new `EFI`

**Step 2** -- Use [OC-Gen-X](https://github.com/Pavo-IM/OC-Gen-X) to generate the latest version of `OC`

**Step 3** -- Copy the `ACPI` and `KEXT` files from the older version of OC to the newer version of OC (Notes: JUST COPY what are not on the `kext` folder generated by `OC-Gen-X`!!!)

**Step 4** -- Copy the previous version of `config.plist` to the new `EFI` folder

**Step 5** -- Open the `config.plist` with [Propertree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) then use `Cmd + R` and select the `OC` folder to load the new drivers to the `config.plist`

**Step 6** -- Modify `Platforminfo` > `Generic` > `MLB`, `SystemSerialNumber`, and `SystemUUID` in the new `config.plist` to match the data in the old `config.plist`

**Step 7** -- Modify `Misc` > `PickerMode` set from `Builtin` to `External`, `ShowPicker` to `True` in `config.plist`. This will enable the Graphic Picker feature at boot.

**Step 8** -- Go through the new `config.plist` with [OpenCore Sanity Checker](https://opencore.slowgeek.com/), if everything is satisfied in the check list, the new `EFI` should be good to go
